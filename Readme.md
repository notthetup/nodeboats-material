# Nodeboat Builder

**Nodeboat Builder workshop at [JSConf.Asia 2014](http://2014.jsconf.asia/)**

**Date** : 20th November 2014

**Venue** : Amara Sanctuary, Sentosa, Singapore

**Time** : 9.15am - 5:30pm *Catch the race at 5:15pm!*

## Aim

Let's Make something! Inspired by [NodeBoats at JSConf](http://makezine.com/2014/06/02/turning-coders-into-makers-at-jsconf-2014/)

Let's build boats that can be controlled by web technologies. We will make boats that can communicate over WiFi to a Node app.

The exact design of the boat and the control will be up to the individual team's creativity.

## Teams

- Maximum of 12 teams (that's all we can accommodate in the room)
- Each team has 2 members

## Competition

We will have a competition at the end of the day using the boats everyone created. The exact goal of the competition will be announced during the workshop.

The competition will be held at the **Dream Pool at 5.15pm**

## Pool times for testing

We can only use the pool to test our boats for 30mins at 3pm, 4pm and 5pm.

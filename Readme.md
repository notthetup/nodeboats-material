## Aim

Let's Make something! Inspired by [NodeBoats at JSConf](makezine.com/2014/06/02/turning-coders-into-makers-at-jsconf-2014/)

Let's build boats that can be controlled by Web technologies. We will make boats that can communicate over WiFi to a Node app.

The exacty design of the boat and the control will be up to the individual teams to come up with.

## Teams

- Maximum of 12 teams (that's all we can accomodate in the room)
- Teams of 2

## Competition

We will have a competition at the end of the day using the boats everyone created. The exact goal of the competition will be announced during the workshop.

The competition will be held at the Dream Pool at 5.15pm

## Pool time

We can only use the pool to test our boats for 30mins at 3pm, 4pm and 5pm.
